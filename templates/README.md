# BrandEasy customer templates

This folder contains templates with basic configuration and content for BrandEasy customers that you can copy to the `site/customers` folder and rename to the customer name (lowercase) to get started with setting up a new customer portal.

Customize the customer portal by editing the content and styling files in the copied folder.

**Please note:** You also need to set up user groups and default accounts for the customer in Xinet. See [this wiki page](http://wiki.brandfactory.se/index.php/Konfigurera_ny_kund_i_Brand_Easy) for more steps and instructions on setting up a BrandEasy customer.
